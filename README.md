# The Great C++ Mathematical Expression Parser Benchmark

This is a benchmark suite for different implementations of open source math expression parsers and evaluators written in C++. Currently the following expression parsers are part of this benchmark:

## The Setup

The benchmark takes two parameters:

    Number of iterations (N)
    Benchmark Test File

The benchmark files are as follows:

    bench_expr.txt
    bench_expr_all.txt
    bench_expr_all_permutations.txt
    bench_expr_complete.txt
    bench_expr_extensive.txt
    bench_expr_precedence.txt
    bench_expr_random_with_functions.txt
    bench_expr_random_without_functions.txt
    bench_expr_weird.txt

As an example, the following execution will use the [*"bench_expr_all.txt"*](https://github.com/ArashPartow/math-parser-benchmark-project/blob/master/bench_expr_all.txt) set of expressions, executing each expression 100000 times.

    ParserBench.exe 100000 bench_expr_all.txt

## The Rounds
For every expression in the benchmark file, every parser evaluates the given expression N times, this is known as a round. The total time each parser takes to evaluate the expression N times is recorded. Ranking of the parsers for the round is done from the fastest to the slowest.

Parsers that can't parse the expression or produce a result different to the expected result (based on a normalized epsilon approach) are disqualified for the round and do not participate in point accumulation.

## The Summary
Once all the expressions have been completed, a summary is provided, that includes information relating to the build parameters of the benchmark binary, the architecture which the benchmark was run upon, a final ranking of the parsers, and a listing of expressions per parser that were deemed as disqualified during the benchmark.

## The Results
The summaries of runs of the benchmark suite upon various architectures can be found here: [Results](https://github.com/ArashPartow/math-parser-benchmark-project/tree/master/logs)

## Example Results
The following is a chart depicting the results as executions per second obtained by running the ['bench_expr_random_without_functions.txt'](https://github.com/ArashPartow/math-parser-benchmark-project/blob/master/bench_expr_random_without_functions.txt) benchmark, using the double type, 500000 iterations per expression on an Intel Xeon W3680 3GHz. The horizontal measure on the chart is the length of the expression in bytes.

**Note:** The parsers *muParserSSE*, *ExprTKFloat* and *LuaJit* were excluded due to their use of the float type, and the *Lepton* and *muParserX* parsers were excluded due to the fact that their results were consistently 2-3 orders of magnitude slower than all the others.
